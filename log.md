# Time Log / Journal

## 28 July 2024 Sun

Notes

* One of the resistor networks ordered was wrong, it was an SMD part.
* The value of that part was 4.7K but it's not on the BOM. I ordered the part
  from the BOM which is 10K. I don't think it's critical.
 
Time

* Started working at 14:30
* Took two 30 minute breks
* Stopped working at 21:00
