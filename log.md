# Time Log / Journal

27 July 2024 Sat

Time

* 2 hours checking Mouser order, and ordering a missed part (resistor network)

Notes

* One of the resistor networks ordered was wrong, it was an SMD part.
* The value of that part was 4.7K but it's not on the BOM. I ordered the part
  from the BOM which is 10K. I don't think it's critical.
