# Ambika Build Checklist

# Note: for these instructions it is assumed the motherboard PCB is oriented
# such that Atmel 644p is at the lower left-hand side and legends for ICs
# are oriented t the top of footprints.

Resistors

# These four are, left to right, flanking the optocoupler with the label OK1
# with that label being right-side up at the upper left, the notch of the IC
# facing "up".
