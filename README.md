# Ambika Build Notes

This repo contains extensive notes concerning the build of a Mutable
Instruments Ambika synthesizer. In my case, I'm building the Ambika fully
populated with six 4PM cards. 

My motivation for taking these notes is that the project is no longer
officially supported, and some of the PCB's available are not well-marked.
For example, the motherboard that I received was missing many legends for
parts, making the build process more tedious.

At the present time, aside from this **README.md** file, are **log.md**
and **checklist.txt**.  The former contains a time log (how much time it
took me to build, with a caveat mentioned below) nad the latter is a
checklist modeled after the checklists of Heathkits and others, which
offered very detailed instructions for each part.

How long will it take you to build an Ambika? Hopefully not as long as it
will take me. While I've logged the time for my own records, I don't think
this will be reflective of your experience, necessarily. That's because I'm
included all the time it takes to author the checklist on-the-fly.
