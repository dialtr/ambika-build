# Ambika Build Checklist

# Note: for these instructions it is assumed the motherboard PCB is oriented
# such that Atmel 644p is at the lower left-hand side and legends for ICs
# are oriented t the top of footprints.

Resistors

# These four are, left to right, flanking the optocoupler with the label OK1
# with that label being right-side up at the upper left, the notch of the IC
# facing "up".

# These seven 470R resistors are for output protection. Solder six of them in

# Near the rectangular hole for the display, there is a pad for a resistor
# at the top-right. The resistor is not labeled but shows a jumper lead. The
# Ambika instructions say that most displays don't need an external resistor
# for display brightness, but that Optrex displays need a 100R resistor.
# Since I don't know which display this is, I am electing to install a 51R
# resistor to split the difference. If the display is not bright enough then
# I'll remove it and install a jumper. I've opted to use a 10% R that's tan
# in color to draw attention to this change.
[ ] R?? 51R  # Note: this may need to be 0R to get correct display brightness.

# There is a resistor network labeled RN1 a the top-middle of the board. It is
# roughly between J2 and J3. Above that, there is a resistor labeled "4.7K to
# 10K". This sets gain for the mix output. The value of 4.7K or 6.8K is
# suggested if you plan to install all six voice cards. Since I do, I am going
# to go ahead and install a 4K7 resistor and make note of this for later if
# the levels are too low. As above, I will use a tan-colored, 10% resistor
# here to make it a little more obvious that the value is contended in some
# way

# Flip the board over, so that the legends are readable in the orientation.
# to the lower left of the rectangular hole for the display, there is an IC
# that may be marked IC10 but is marked IC13 on the Ambika instructions. To
# the left of that, there are locations for 7 470R current-limiting resistors
